open_run

Description: 
Open a run into a netlist or implementation design

Syntax: 
open_run  [-name <arg>] [-pr_config <arg>] [-quiet] [-verbose] <run>

Returns: 
design object

Usage: 
  Name          Description
  -------------------------
  [-name]       Design name
  [-pr_config]  PR Configuration to apply while opening the design (only 
                valid when opening a synthesis run)
  [-quiet]      Ignore command errors
  [-verbose]    Suspend message limits during command execution
  <run>         Run to open into the design

Categories: 
Project

Description:

  Opens the specified synthesis run into a Netlist Design or implementation
  run into an Implemented Design. The run properties defining the target part
  and constraint set are combined with the synthesis or implementation
  results to create the design view in the tool.

  This command is intended to open a synthesized or implemented design that
  was created from design runs in Project Mode in the Vivado Design Suite.

  Use the open_checkpoint command to open a Non-Project based checkpoint into
  memory, opening the design in Non-Project Mode. Refer to the Vivado Design
  Suite User Guide: Design Flows Overview (UG892) for more information on
  Project Mode and Non-Project Mode.

Arguments:

  -name - (Optional) This is the name assigned to the synthesized or
  implemented design when the run is opened by the Vivado tool. This name is
  for reference purposes, and has nothing to do with the top-level of the
  design or any logic contained within.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <run> - (Required) Specifies the run name of the synthesis or
  implementation run to open. The run must have completed synthesis or
  implementation before it can be opened as a design.

  Note: If you attempt to open a run that has not been launched the tool will
  return an error.

Examples:

  The following command opens the specified synthesis run into a Netlist
  Design named synthPass1:

    open_run -name synthPass1 synth_1 
    

  The following opens an Implemented Design for impl_1:

    open_run impl_1
