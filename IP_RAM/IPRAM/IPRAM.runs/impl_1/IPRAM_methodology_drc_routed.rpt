2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ram/U0/synth_options.dist_mem_inst/gen_sp_ram.spram_inst/ram_reg_0_31_0_0/SP/CLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ram/U0/synth_options.dist_mem_inst/gen_sp_ram.spram_inst/ram_reg_0_31_1_1/SP/CLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ram/U0/synth_options.dist_mem_inst/gen_sp_ram.spram_inst/ram_reg_0_31_2_2/SP/CLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ram/U0/synth_options.dist_mem_inst/gen_sp_ram.spram_inst/ram_reg_0_31_3_3/SP/CLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ram/U0/synth_options.dist_mem_inst/gen_sp_ram.spram_inst/ram_reg_0_31_4_4/SP/CLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ram/U0/synth_options.dist_mem_inst/gen_sp_ram.spram_inst/ram_reg_0_31_5_5/SP/CLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ram/U0/synth_options.dist_mem_inst/gen_sp_ram.spram_inst/ram_reg_0_31_6_6/SP/CLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ram/U0/synth_options.dist_mem_inst/gen_sp_ram.spram_inst/ram_reg_0_31_7_7/SP/CLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O, ram/clk
Related violations: <none>
